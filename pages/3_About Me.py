Hello, my name is Banu, and I'm currently studying Data Science at Purwadhika Bandung. 
I have a deep passion for Dota 2, having accumulated over 10,000 hours of gameplay. 
Leveraging my experience, I'm working on a recommendation system to assist Dota 2 players when their favorite hero
is either picked by another player or banned.
